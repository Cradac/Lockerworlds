# Lockerworld

## Info

Lockerworld is a game developed for the Ludum Dare 56 Game Jam with the topic Tiny Creatures in a timespan of 72 hours.

We were inspired a scene in the movie "Men in Black 2" to create a god-simulator type game where you work at a facility where you have to take care of tiny creatures living in lockers. Make sure the lockerlings don't drown, set things on fire or become electricuted while reading a book. And beware of Godotzilla!

The game was developed in the Godot Game Engine.
